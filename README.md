# Tiny Dino Run

Practice game made based on the idea presented in the video [How to Make a Google Chrome T-Rex Style Sidescroller In Godot | Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKBhz6oJYsc) by [Coding With Russ](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithRuss)

The code for the parallax background, ground and basic movement has been initially copied from that video and expanded upon afterwards.

Title is made with ChatGPT
