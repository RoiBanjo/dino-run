# Tiny Dino Run

You can play the game [here](https://roibanjo.itch.io/tiny-dino-run)

This is a practice game made based on the game idea presented in the video [How to Make a Google Chrome T-Rex Style Sidescroller In Godot | Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKBhz6oJYsc) by [Coding With Russ](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithRuss). The code for the parallax background, ground and basic movement is initially taken from that video and expanded upon afterwards.
